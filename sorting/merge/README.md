# Blog Notes: Merge Sort

In this challenge we were tasked with working through a Merge Sort algorithm for understanding given the pseudocode and an example input array; afterwards/while doing so, we were to write out a blog style document of the process and each pass of the algorithm.

Then, we were tasked with coding out the Merge Sort algorithm and write tests to verify the code works.
