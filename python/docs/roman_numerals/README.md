# Challenge Summary

Our challenge is to code out an approach to converting a roman numeral into the more common Arabic numeral format based upon a blog entry we are provided.

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach I took iterates through the input string and makes comparisons and conversions and adds up a total. Because of this, the approach would be O(n) for time and O(1) for space.
